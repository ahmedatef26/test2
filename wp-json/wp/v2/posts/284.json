It\u2019s late Tuesday night and my kids need a bath\u2013and, well, this isn\u2019t complicated: public schools in the United States need to continue to use remote learning in the 2020-2021 school year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I know it\u2019s not that simple. As I wrote late last week in\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teachthought.com\/education\/teachers-frontline-of-fight-against-covid\/\">Teachers Are Suddenly On The Frontlines In The Fight Against COVID-19<\/a><\/strong>, teachers are now in a kind of morass. As COVID-19 rages in the United States with no signs of easing up soon, Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos have recently begun an aggressive push to open school buildings in the fall.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While the negative effects of remote learning have been well-explored, few things are all bad. We\u2019ve mentioned that the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.teachthought.com\/technology\/the-long-term-effects-of-remote-learning-may-not-be-all-bad\/\">long-term effects of remote learning<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;have some benefits.&nbsp;<strong>Mark Siegel<\/strong>, Assistant Headmaster at&nbsp;Delphian School, talked about how remote learning can give parents a closer look at what their children are actually learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a potential benefit, too, in that many parents now have a chance to better and more fully understand their children\u2019s education\u2013what they\u2019re being taught and how they\u2019re doing in basic subjects. After going through all this, they might feel more confident taking the reins of education in their children\u2019s lives. And as parents reclaim the role of teacher, at least to a degree, children might look again to their parents for direction and knowledge.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again\u2013I\u2019m just exploring one side of this. There\u2019s simply so much to consider. But while I do believe that re-opening school buildings in the United States in the fall of 2020 is dangerous in terms of COVID, this post isn\u2019t about the epidemiology. Rather, it\u2019s about the existing momentum\u2013in lieu of the often significant failures and shortcomings\u2013that\u2019s been created with remote learning so far.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, a few statements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>7 Reasons Schools Should Continue To Use Remote Learning In The United States<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I. The near-future of learning is almost certainly&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.teachthought.com\/learning\/the-definition-of-blended-learning\/\"><strong>blended learning<\/strong><\/a>\u2013a mix of digital and face-to-face instruction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>II. By moving to remote learning, schools have had to take stock in resources\u2013and resource deficits\u2013necessary to meaningfully integrate eLearning in pursuit of remote learning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>III. This process has forced curriculum (what\u2019s being learned), instruction (how it\u2019s being taught), and supporting resources (e.g., Zoom and Microsoft Teams) to be designed\u2013and re-designed\u2013to work together.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IV. This process has been slow and clumsy and likely resulted in \u2018learning loss.\u2019 But \u2018loss\u2019 compared to what? Being in a safe physical space\u2013one that won\u2019t likely exist for 6+ months?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>V. In that respect, it\u2019s possible to consider what we\u2019re doing as part of an \u2018implementation dip\u2019\u2013a temporary loss before a larger gain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VI. Of course, no one knows what will happen in the future with COVID-19 or with remote learning and its long-term effects. I am not championing it as particularly effective or innovative. What I\u2019m suggesting is that we\u2019ve already experienced the loss and have begun to adapt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And considering that the near-future of learning is likely blended, it just might make sense to continue down this path even if school buildings can safely re-open in the fall (which seems unlikely). These buildings can still support students who need the support of these spaces and the resources of the schools and the socialization of their peers\u2013it just doesn\u2019t have to look like the school they remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VII. I know this is all unlikely to occur but I thought it should be said: The near-future of learning is blended and we\u2019ve spent a century developing the brick-and-mortar spaces.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe we can spend another six or eight months developing the digital ones, too\u2013and not as an aside, but as the focal point of a more personalized learning experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Massa tempor nec feugiat nisl pretium.
