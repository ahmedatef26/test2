In major world markets, the business world globalized decades ago, expanding beyond domestic markets in pursuit of more diverse audiences and stronger profits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while major players in business continue to experiment and find their way in markets whose culture and buying practices diverge from those domestic, the \u2018field\u2019 of education has been slow to follow suit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is made all the more strange by the relationship between education and economic systems. If one goal of education is to prepare a \u2018workforce,\u2019 the more parallel the system of education is with the workforce, the less \u2018waste\u2019 there might be. While industrialism, commercialism, religion, and technology all reach out across political and geographical borders, education lags awkwardly behind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most startling reality here might be the jarring power of juxtaposition: stakeholders in education everywhere struggle for change\u2014meaningful, sustained movement in a new direction\u2013yet within education overall, there is relatively little progress compared to tangent fields, including science, technology, entertainment, and business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For education, somewhere there is a tether, likely rooted in&nbsp;sentimentality and disconnection. The learning process has become so culturally detached from the&nbsp;communities it is designed to serve that families are no longer sure what quality education looks like,&nbsp;resulting in blind trust of an education system that struggles itself to plan, measure, and remediate&nbsp;learning, all the while families stand aside unsure of their role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Defining Global Learning<\/strong><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20150703124822\/\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/09\/dfidukdepartmentforinternationaldevelopment.jpg\"><\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Globalization is less a singular initiative than it is the effect of a thousand initiatives, many of which are currently under-developed. When defining a \u2018global curriculum,\u2019 one issue that must be confronted is the issue of perspective: Do we all have the same definition of \u2018global,\u2019 and do we understand the word \u201ccurriculum\u201d on common ground?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In brief, let\u2019s agree that in this context, \u2018global\u2019 is a word that describes anything that is truly worldwide in its awareness, interdependence, and application. Right away, the scale of any such endeavor should appear, at best, intimidating, and, at worst, impossible with any degree of intimacy. Beyond that which is geologic and atmospheric, few things can truly maintain wholeness while being \u2018global.\u2019 Global implies a scale that\u2019s not just ambitious and comprehensive, but truly&nbsp;<strong>inclusive by definition<\/strong>. Things can\u2019t be \u2018partially global\u2019 any more than the lights can be partially turned on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if \u2018global\u2019 is fully interdependent and inclusive, what about the curriculum part? For the purpose of this piece, we\u2019ll say that&nbsp;<strong>a&nbsp;curriculum is intentionally designed of learning content and experiences<\/strong>. It may be more or less planned and scripted, created backward from a sort of curriculum map into units, lessons, and activities, or far more open as \u2018learning pathways,\u2019&nbsp; each a different style of curriculum. To clarify, learning standards such as the Common Core are not curriculum, but are rather ingredients with which you can create your own.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what then does a \u2018global curriculum\u2019 require and imply? And how do we get there from here?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term \u2018global\u2019 tends toward business, marketing, and technological connotation, which is always dangerous. The ambition of business leaders, technology inventors, and scientists alike shows less respect for the practical than the possible. While exciting in theory, it flaunts a hubris that should serve as a warning for&nbsp;fields with much more to lose than money or shareholders.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In high-stakes testing environments prevalent in many formal learning institutions, the focus is on standards and standard-mastery. \u2018Globalization\u2019 is a haughty kind of \u2018pie in the sky\u2019 idea thought about only when watching one of the \u201cShift Happens\u201d videos on YouTube, or daydreaming on the drive home from a challenging day in the classroom where there is time to honestly reflect on\u2014in solitude\u2014the kind of education teachers can only dream they could provide students.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":264,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[61],"tags":[64,69],"aioseo_notices":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/288"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=288"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/288\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/264"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=288"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=288"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/mohamedwasfi.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=288"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
