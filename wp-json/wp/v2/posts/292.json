Rather than only \u2018writing teachers,\u2019 teaching reading and writing, now all teachers across all content areas are being asked to do so (something&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.teachthought.com\/common-core-2\/the-most-significant-change-of-common-core-adoption\/\"><strong>we\u2019ve talked about<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;before).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In the past, literacy\u2014the ability to read, write, and understand\u2014has been the domain of the English-Language Arts teachers (and elsewhere in the world, Literature and Composition teachers).<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Limiting the craft of writing to a single content area has altered the landscape of students\u2019 minds in ways that are only now being revealed as math teachers are told to teach writing.
